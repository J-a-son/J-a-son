Hello World
- 👋 Hi, I’m Jason Clarke: @J-a-son
- 👀 I’m interested in GIS
- 🌱 I’m currently reading Applied GIS at the University of Sheffield
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate yet 
- 📫 How to reach till Sep 2024: via department: https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/usp
- 😄 Pronouns: I have never chosen the names that groups I have lived and worked in have given me. I probably still respond to old ones. I'm not fussed about being given new ones.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Google Bard told me I was the first person to ask it what the answer was to the ultimate question of life the universe and everything.
